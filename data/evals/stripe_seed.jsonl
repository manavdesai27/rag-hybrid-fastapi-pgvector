{"question": "What is idempotency in Stripe APIs?", "ground_truth": "Idempotency keys let you safely retry requests without performing the same operation twice. Send an Idempotency-Key header with a unique value for a create or mutating request; Stripe reuses the original response for subsequent requests with the same key."}
{"question": "How do I create a PaymentIntent?", "ground_truth": "Use the Payment Intents API: create a PaymentIntent server-side with amount, currency, and optional payment_method_types; then confirm it on the client or server depending on your integration. The response includes status that may require further action (e.g., authentication)."}
{"question": "How can I verify Stripe webhook signatures?", "ground_truth": "Use the signing secret from your webhook endpoint and validate the Stripe-Signature header of incoming events. The official libraries include helpers to construct the event with signature verification and a tolerance window."}
{"question": "What are Connect accounts?", "ground_truth": "Stripe Connect accounts represent the merchants or service providers on a platform. You can create Standard, Express, or Custom accounts, each with different onboarding and responsibility trade-offs."}
{"question": "How do I handle webhook retries?", "ground_truth": "Stripe automatically retries failed webhook deliveries using exponential backoff. Your endpoint should return a 2xx status on success, be idempotent, and you can configure endpoints and view event delivery attempts in the dashboard."}
{"question": "Which header is used for idempotency in Stripe?", "ground_truth": "Use the Idempotency-Key HTTP header to provide a unique key per operation."}
{"question": "Where can I find API keys in Stripe?", "ground_truth": "API keys are available in the Stripe Dashboard under Developers > API keys. Use separate keys for test and live modes and keep them secret."}
{"question": "How do I refund a charge or a payment?", "ground_truth": "Create a Refund via the Refunds API referencing the charge or PaymentIntent; you can refund full or partial amounts. The status indicates whether the refund succeeded or is pending."}
